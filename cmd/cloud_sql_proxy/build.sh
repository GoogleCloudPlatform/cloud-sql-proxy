# build.sh wraps `go build` to make compiling the Cloud SQL Proxy for
# distribution more streamlined. When doing normal development on the proxy,
# `go build .` (or even `go run .`) is sufficient for iterating on the code.
# This script simply allows a convenient way to cross compile and build a docker
# container.
#
# With no arguments, this script will build a binary marked with "development",
# otherwise the binary version will be annotated with the string provided.
#
#    # Build a binary labeled with 'development'
#    ./build.sh
#
#    # Build a binary labeled with 'beta'
#    ./build.sh beta
#
# Specifying 'release' as the first argument to this script will cross compile
# for all supported operating systems and architectures. This requires a version
# identifier to be supplied as the second argument:
#
#    # Build a binary for each of the supported platforms labeled with '0.001'
#    ./build.sh release 0.001
#
# Specifying docker as the first argument to this script will build a
# container, tagging it with the identifier in the second argument.
#
#    # Build a docker container named 'cloud-sql-proxy:my-tag'
#    ./build docker my-tag
