## Cloud SQL Proxy
The Cloud SQL Proxy allows a user with the appropriate permissions to connect
to a Second Generation Cloud SQL database without having to deal with IP whitelisting or SSL
certificates manually. It works by opening unix/tcp sockets on the local machine
and proxying connections to the associated Cloud SQL instances when the sockets
are used.

To build from source, ensure you have [go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install)
and have set [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH). Then, simply do a go get:

    GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-proxy/cmd/cloud_sql_proxy

The cloud_sql_proxy will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin` after `go get` completes.

cloud_sql_proxy takes a few arguments to configure what instances to connect to and connection behavior:

* `-fuse`: requires access to `/dev/fuse` as well as the `fusermount` binary. An
  optional `-fuse_tmp` flag can specify where to place temporary files. The
  directory indicated by `-dir` is mounted.
* `-instances="project1:region:instance1,project3:region:instance1"`: A comma-separated list
  of instances to open inside `-dir`. Also supports exposing a tcp port and renaming the default Unix Domain Sockets; see examples below.
  Same list can be provided via INSTANCES environment variable, in case when both are provided - proxy will use command line flag.
* `-instances_metadata=metadata_key`: Usable on [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart) only. The given [GCE metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata) key will be
  polled for a list of instances to open in `-dir`. The metadata key is relative from `computeMetadata/v1/`. The format for the value is the same as the 'instances' flag. A hanging-poll strategy is used, meaning that changes to
  the metadata value will be reflected in the `-dir` even while the proxy is
  running. When an instance is removed from the list the corresponding socket
  will be removed from `-dir` as well (unless it was also specified in
  `-instances`), but any existing connections to this instance will NOT be
  terminated.
* `-ip_address_types=PUBLIC,PRIVATE`: A comma-delimited list of preferred IP
  types for connecting to an instance. For example, setting this to PRIVATE will
  force the proxy to connect to instances using an instance's associated private
  IP. Defaults to `PUBLIC,PRIVATE`
* `-term_timeout=30s`: How long to wait for connections to close before shutting
  down the proxy. Defaults to 0.
* `-skip_failed_instance_config`: Setting this flag will allow you to prevent the proxy from terminating when
	some instance configurations could not be parsed and/or are unavailable.
* `-log_debug_stdout=true`: This is to log non-error output to stdOut instead of stdErr. For example, if you don't want connection related messages to log as errors, set this flag to true. Defaults to false.
* `-close_idle=true`: Enable closing "idle" connections during the shutdown grace period.
* `-close_idle_timeout=5s`: How long to wait before considering a connection "idle" (during shutdown).

Note: `-instances` and `-instances_metadata` may be used at the same time but
are not compatible with the `-fuse` flag.

cloud_sql_proxy authentication can be configured in a few different ways. Those listed higher on the list will override options lower on the list:

1. `credential_file` flag
2. `token` flag
3. Service account key at path stored in `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
4. gcloud _user_ credentials (set from `gcloud auth login`)
5. Default Application Credentials via goauth:

   1. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (again)
   2. gcloud _application default_ credentials (set from ` gcloud auth application-default login`)
   3. appengine.AccessToken (for App Engine Go < =1.9)
   4. GCE/GAE metadata credentials

When the proxy authenticates under the default service account of the
Compute Engine VM it is running on the VM must have at least the
sqlservice.admin API scope ("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin")
and the associated project must have the SQL Admin API
enabled.  The default service account must also have at least WRITER/EDITOR
priviledges to any projects of target SQL instances.

Specifying the `-credential_file` flag allows use of the proxy outside of
Google's cloud. Simply [create a new service
account](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#create-service-account),
download the associated JSON file, and set `-credential_file` to the path of the
JSON file. You can also set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
instead of passing this flag.

## Example invocations:

    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst &
    mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst

    # To retrieve instances from a custom metadata value (only when running on GCE)
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances_metadata instance/attributes/<custom-metadata-key> &
    mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst

    # For -fuse you do not need to specify instance names ahead of time:
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -fuse &
    mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst

    # For programs which do not support using Unix Domain Sockets, specify tcp:
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=tcp:3306 &
    mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1

    # For programs which require a certain Unix Domain Socket name:
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=unix:custom_socket_name &
    mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/custom_socket_name

    # For programs which require a the Unix Domain Socket at a specific location, set an absolute path (overrides -dir):
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=unix:/my/custom/sql-socket &
    mysql -u root -S /my/custom/sql-socket

## Container Images

For convenience, we maintain several containerized versions. These images are 
currently hosted in the following GCR repositories:
   * `gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
   * `us.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
   * `eu.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
   * `asia.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`

__Note:__ 

Each image is tagged with the version of the proxy it was released with. The 
following tags are currently supported:
  * `$VERSION` - default image (recommended)
  * `$VERSION-alpine` - uses [`alpine:3`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) as a base image (only supported from v1.17 up)
  * `$VERSION-buster` - uses [`debian:buster`](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) as a base image (only supported from v1.17 up)

__Note:__ We strongly recommend to always use the latest version of the proxy,
and to update the version regularly. However, we recommend pinning to a
specific tag and avoid the `latest` tag. Additionally, please note that
the tagged version is _only_ that of the proxy - changes in base images may 
break specific setups, even on non-major version increments. As such,
it's a best practice to test changes before deployment, and use automated
rollbacks to revert potential failures.
