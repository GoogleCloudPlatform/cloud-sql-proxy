# Cloud SQL Auth proxy

![CI][ci-badge]
[![Go Reference][pkg-badge]][pkg-docs]

The [Cloud SQL Auth proxy][proxy-page] is a binary that provides IAM-based
authorization and encryption when connecting to a Cloud SQL instance.

See the [Connecting Overview][connection-overview] page for more information on
connecting to a Cloud SQL instance, or the [About the proxy][about-proxy] page
for details on how the Cloud SQL proxy works.

Note: The Proxy *cannot* provide a network path to a Cloud SQL instance if one
is not already present (e.g., the proxy cannot access a VPC if it does not
already have access to it).

## Installation

For 64-bit Linux, run:

```
VERSION=v1.21.0 # see Releases for other versions
wget "https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudsql-proxy/$VERSION/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64" -O cloud_sql_proxy
chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy
```

Releases for additional OS's and architectures and be found on the [releases
page][releases].

For alternative distributions, see below under [third party](#third-party).

### Container Images

There are containerized versions of the proxy available from the following
Google Cloud Container Registry repositories:

* `gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
* `us.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
* `eu.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`
* `asia.gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy`

Each image is tagged with the associated proxy version. The following tags are
currently supported:

* `$VERSION` - default image (recommended)
* `$VERSION-alpine` - uses [`alpine:3`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)
  as a base image (only supported from v1.17 up)
* `$VERSION-buster` - uses [`debian:buster`](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)
  as a base image (only supported from v1.17 up)

We recommend using the latest version of the proxy and updating the version
regularly. However, we also recommend pinning to a specific tag and avoid the
latest tag. Note: the tagged version is only that of the proxy. Changes in base
images may break specific setups, even on non-major version increments. As such,
it's a best practice to test changes before deployment, and use automated
rollbacks to revert potential failures.

**NOTE**: As of v1.16, the default container image uses [distroless][]. If you
require a shell or similar tools, use the Alpine or Buster images listed above.

### Install from Source

To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of [Go
installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then, simply run:

```
go install github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-proxy/cmd/cloud_sql_proxy@latest
```

The `cloud_sql_proxy` will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

## Usage

All the following invocations assume valid credentials are present in the
environment. The following examples all reference an `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`,
which takes the form: `myproject:myregion:myinstance`. To find the
`INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`, run `gcloud sql instances describe <INSTANCE_NAME>`
where `INSTANCE_NAME` is the name of the database instance.

### TCP socket example

``` bash
# Starts the proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:5432
cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:5432
```

``` bash
# Starts the proxy listening on port 5432 on *all* interfaces
cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:0.0.0.0:5432
```

### Unix socket example

``` bash
# The proxy will mount a Unix domain socket at /cloudsql/<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>
# Note: The directory specified by `-dir` must exist and the socket file path
# (i.e., dir plus INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME) must be under your platform's
# limit (typically 108 characters on many Unix systems, but varies by platform).
cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>
```

### Private IP example

```
cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:5432 -ip_address_types=PRIVATE
```

In order to connect using Private IP, you must have access through your
project's VPC. For more details, see [Private IP Requirements][private-ip].

## Credentials

The Cloud SQL proxy uses a Cloud IAM account to authorize connections against a
Cloud SQL instance. The proxy sources the credentials for these accounts in the
following order:

1. The `-credential_file` flag
2. The `-token` flag
3. The service account key at the path stored in the
   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
4. The gcloud user credentials (set from `gcloud auth login`)
5. The [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production)

Note: Any account connecting to a Cloud SQL database will need one of the
following IAM roles:

- Cloud SQL Client (preferred)
- Cloud SQL Editor
- Cloud SQL Admin

Or one may manually assign the following IAM permissions:

- `cloudsql.instances.connect`
- `cloudsql.instances.get`

See [Roles and Permissions in Cloud SQL][roles-and-permissions] for details.

When the proxy authenticates under the Compute Engine VM's default service
account, the VM must have at least the `sqlservice.admin` API scope (i.e.,
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin") and the associated project
must have the SQL Admin API enabled. The default service account must also have
at least writer or editor privileges to any projects of target SQL instances.


## CLI Flags

The Cloud SQL Auth proxy takes a few arguments to configure what instances to connect
to and connection behavior. For a full list of flags supported by the proxy,
use `cloud_sql_proxy -help`.

### Authentication Flags

#### `-credential_file`

Specifies the path to a JSON [service account][service-account] key the proxy
uses to authorize or authenticate connections.

#### `-token`

When set, the proxy uses this Bearer token for authorization.

#### `-enable_iam_login`

Enables the proxy to use Cloud SQL IAM database authentication. This will cause
the proxy to use IAM account credentials for database user authentication. For
details, see [Overview of Cloud SQL IAM database authentication][iam-auth].
NOTE: This feature only works with Postgres database instances.

### Connection Flags

#### `-instances="project1:region:instance1,project3:region:instance1"`

A comma-separated list of instances to open inside `-dir`. Also supports
exposing a TCP port and renaming the default Unix Domain Sockets; see examples
below.  Same list can be provided via INSTANCES environment variable, in case
when both are provided - proxy will use command line flag.

**Example**

Using TCP sockets:

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=tcp:3306 &
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1
```

Using Unix sockets:

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst &
mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst
```

To specify a custom Unix socket name:

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql \
    -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=unix:custom_socket_name &
mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/custom_socket_name
```

To specify a custom location for a Unix socket (overrides `-dir`):

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql \
    -instances=my-project:us-central1:sql-inst=unix:/my/custom/sql-socket &
mysql -u root -S /my/custom/sql-socket
```

#### `-fuse`

Requires access to `/dev/fuse` as well as the `fusermount` binary. An optional
`-fuse_tmp` flag can specify where to place temporary files. The directory
indicated by `-dir` is mounted.

**Example**

Using `-fuse`, you do not need to specify instance names ahead of time:

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -fuse &
mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst
```

#### `-instances_metadata=metadata_key`

Usable on [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart) only. The
given [GCE metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata) key will be
polled for a list of instances to open in `-dir`. The metadata key is relative
from `computeMetadata/v1/`. The format for the value is the same as the
'instances' flag. A hanging-poll strategy is used, meaning that changes to the
metadata value will be reflected in the `-dir` even while the proxy is running.
When an instance is removed from the list the corresponding socket will be
removed from `-dir` as well (unless it was also specified in `-instances`), but
any existing connections to this instance will NOT be terminated.

**Example**

```
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql \
    -instances_metadata instance/attributes/<custom-metadata-key> &
mysql -u root -S /cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:sql-inst
```

Note: `-instances` and `-instances_metadata` may be used at the same time but
are not compatible with the `-fuse` flag.

#### `-max_connections`

If provided, the maximum number of connections to establish before refusing new
connections. Defaults to 0 (no limit).

### Additional Flags

#### `-ip_address_types=PUBLIC,PRIVATE`

A comma-delimited list of preferred IP types for connecting to an instance. For
example, setting this to PRIVATE will force the proxy to connect to instances
using an instance's associated private IP. Defaults to `PUBLIC,PRIVATE`

#### `-term_timeout=30s`

How long to wait for connections to close after receiving a SIGTERM before
shutting down the proxy. Defaults to 0. If all connections close before the
duration, the proxy will shutdown early.

#### `-skip_failed_instance_config`

Setting this flag will prevent the proxy from terminating if any errors occur
during instance configuration. Please note that this means some instances may
fail to be set up correctly while others may work if the proxy restarts.

#### `-log_debug_stdout=true`

This is to log non-error output to standard out instead of standard error. For
example, if you don't want connection related messages to log as errors, set
this flag to true.  Defaults to false.

#### `-structured_logs`

Writes all logging output as JSON with the following keys: severity, timestamp, caller,
message and optionally stacktrace. For example, the startup message looks like:

```json
{"severity":"INFO","timestamp":"2020-10-12T07:20:50.52Z","caller":"cloud_sql_proxy/cloud_sql_proxy.go:510","message":"Using gcloud's active project: [my-project-id]"}
```

#### `-use_http_health_check`

Enables HTTP health checks for the proxy, including startup, liveness, and readiness probing.
Requires that you configure the Kubernetes container with HTTP probes ([instructions][health-check-example]).

#### `-health_check_port=8090`

Specifies the port that the health check server listens and serves on. Defaults to 8090.

## Running as a Kubernetes Sidecar

See the [example here][sidecar-example] as well as [Connecting from Google
Kubernetes Engine][connect-to-k8s].

## Running behind a Socks5 proxy

The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy includes support for sending requests through a SOCKS5
proxy. If a SOCKS5 proxy is running on `localhost:8000`, the command to start
the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy would look like:

```
ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:8000 \
HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://localhost:8000 \
    cloud_sql_proxy -instances=$INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=tcp:5432
```

The `ALL_PROXY` environment variable specifies the proxy for all TCP
traffic to and from a Cloud SQL instance. The `ALL_PROXY` environment variable
supports `socks5` and `socks5h` protocols. To route DNS lookups through a proxy,
use the `socks5h` protocol.

The `HTTPS_PROXY` (or `HTTP_PROXY`) specifies the proxy for all HTTP(S) traffic
to the SQL Admin API. Specifying `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` is only necessary
when you want to proxy this traffic. Otherwise, it is optional. See
[`http.ProxyFromEnvironment`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http@go1.17.3#ProxyFromEnvironment)
for possible values.

## Support policy

### Major version lifecycle

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and uses the
following lifecycle regarding support for a major version:

**Active** - Active versions get all new features and security fixes (that
wouldn’t otherwise introduce a breaking change). New major versions are
guaranteed to be "active" for a minimum of 1 year.
**Deprecated** - Deprecated versions continue to receive security and critical
bug fixes, but do not receive new features. Deprecated versions will be publicly
supported for 1 year.
**Unsupported** - Any major version that has been deprecated for >=1 year is
considered publicly unsupported.

### Supported Go Versions

We test and support at least the latest 3 Go versions. Changes in supported Go
versions will be considered a minor change, and will be noted in the release notes.

### Release cadence
The Cloud SQL Auth proxy aims for a minimum monthly release cadence. If no new
features or fixes have been added, a new PATCH version with the latest
dependencies is released.
