# This demonstrates how to configure a batch job so that it shuts down
# the proxy containers when it has finished processing.
#
# The main job container should send a POST request to the proxy's /quitquitquit
# api when the job process finishes. This will cause the proxy side-car
# container to shut down.
#
# In Kubernetes 1.28, side-car containers will be properly supported, and this
# extra step will become unnecessary.
#
# See https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753
# and https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy-operator/issues/381
